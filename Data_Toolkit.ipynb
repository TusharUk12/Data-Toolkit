        "**Q1.** What is NumPy, and why is it widely used in Python?\n",
        "    \n",
        "    .NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open source Python library that's widely\n",
        "    used in science and engineering. The NumPy library contains\n",
        "    multidimensional array data structures, such as the homogeneous,\n",
        "    N-dimensional ndarray , and a large library of functions that operate\n",
        "    efficiently on these data structures\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q2.** How does broadcasting work in NumPy?\n",
        "    \n",
        "    .Broadcasting in NumPy allows us to perform arithmetic operations on arrays\n",
        "    of different shapes without reshaping them. It automatically adjusts the\n",
        "    Smaller array to match the larger array's shape by replicating its values\n",
        "    along the necessary dimensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q3.** What is a Pandas DataFrame?\n",
        "\n",
        "    .A Pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially\n",
        "    heterogeneous tabular data structure in Python. It is a core component of\n",
        "    the Pandas library, widely used for data manipulation and analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q4.** Explain the use of the groupby() method in Pandas?\n",
        "\n",
        "    . The groupby() method in Pandas is a fundamental tool for data analysis, enabling the \"split-apply-combine\" strategy. This approach involves:\n",
        "**Splitting:**\n",
        "Dividing a DataFrame into groups based on the unique values in one or more specified columns. When you call df.groupby('column_name'), it returns a GroupBy object, which conceptually represents these distinct groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Applying:**\n",
        "Performing an operation on each of these independent groups. This operation can be an aggregation (e.g., sum(), mean(), count(), min(), max()), a transformation (e.g., rank(), shift()), or a custom function defined by the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Combining:**\n",
        "Merging the results of the applied operations back into a single Series or DataFrame. The structure of the combined result depends on the applied function.\n",

        "**Q5.** Why is Seaborn preferred for statistical visualizations?\n",
        "\n",
        "    . Seaborn is more than just a tool for creating attractive plots—it's a\n",

        "\n",
        "**Q6.** What are the differences between NumPy arrays and Python lists?\n",
        "\n",
        "    . The main difference is that NumPy arrays are much faster and have strict\n",
        "    requirements on the homogeneity of the objects. For example, a NumPy array\n",
        "    of strings can only contain strings and no other data types, but a Python\n",
        "    list can contain a mixture of strings, numbers, booleans and other objects\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q7.** What is a heatmap, and when should it be used?\n",
        "\n",
        "    . A heatmap is a graphical representation of data that uses a system of\n",
        "    color coding to represent different values. Heatmaps are used in various\n",

        "**Q8.** What does the term “vectorized operation” mean in NumPy?\n",

        "    . Vectorized operations in NumPy enable the use of efficient, pre-compiled\n",
        "    functions and mathematical operations on NumPy arrays and data sequences.\n",
        "    Vectorization is a method of performing array operations without the use of\n",
        "    for loops\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q9.** A How does Matplotlib differ from Plotly?\n",
        "\n",
        "    . Matplotlib: Is often preferred for academic or highly customized plots\n",
        "    because you can fine-tune just about any aspect of the figure—fonts,\n",
        "    margins, axis scales, etc. Plotly: While still highly customizable,\n",
        "    Plotly's real strength lies in interactivity and web-based visuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q10.** What is the significance of hierarchical indexing in Pandas?\n",
        "\n",
        "    . Hierarchical Indexing, also known as MultiIndexing, is a powerful feature\n",
        "    in Pandas that allows you to have multiple levels of indexing on an axis\n",
        "    (row or column). This capability is particularly useful when dealing with\n",

        "**Q14.** What are the benefits of using Plotly for data visualization?\n",

        "    Ease of Use: With minimal code, you can generate complex plots.\n",
        "    Interactivity: Plots are not just static images; they are interactive and can be easily exported as HTML files.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q15.**  How does NumPy handle multidimensional arrays?\n",
        "\n",
        "    . An ndarray is a (usually fixed-size) multidimensional container of items\n",
        "    of the same type and size. The number of dimensions and items in an array\n",
